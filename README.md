Welcome to my collection of Python projects! This repository contains various mini-projects, including interactive command-line games and useful utility scripts.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The projects are organized into the following directories:

### 🎮 Games
* **Dice Rolling Game** (`dicerollinggame/`): A simulator that mimics the rolling of dice.
* **Number Guessing Game** (`number-guess-game/`): A game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.
* **Rock Paper Scissors** (`rockpapergame/`): A classic implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors where you play against the computer.

### 🛠 Utilities
* **QR Code Generator** (`QR-code-generator-python/`): A tool to generate custom QR codes using Python.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/pratikkdahal/Python-projects.git](https://github.com/pratikkdahal/Python-projects.git)
    cd Python-projects
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Most games utilize Python's built-in libraries (like `random`). However, the QR Code Generator likely requires an external library.
    ```bash
    pip install qrcode[pil]
    ```

## 🕹️ How to Run

Navigate to the specific folder of the project you want to run and execute the Python script.

### 1. QR Code Generator
Generate QR codes for URLs or text.
```bash
cd QR-code-generator-python
# Run the python file found in this directory (e.g., main.py or qr_generator.py)
python <filename>.py

```

### 2. Dice Rolling Game

Simulate a dice roll.

```bash
cd dicerollinggame
python <filename>.py

```

### 3. Number Guessing Game

Test your luck and logic.

```bash
cd number-guess-game
python <filename>.py

```

### 4. Rock Paper Scissors

Play a match against the CPU.

```bash
cd rockpapergame
python <filename>.py

```

*(Note: Replace `<filename>.py` with the actual name of the `.py` file located inside each folder.)*
